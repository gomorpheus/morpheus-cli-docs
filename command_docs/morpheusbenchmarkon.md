#### morpheus benchmark on

```
Usage: morpheus benchmark on
    -q, --quiet                      No Output, do not print to stdout
    -C, --nocolor                    Disable ANSI coloring
    -B, --benchmark                  Print benchmark time and exit/error after the command is finished.
    -V, --debug                      Print extra output for debugging.
    -h, --help                       Print this help

Enable global benchmarking.
This behaves the same as if you were to add the -B switch to every command.
